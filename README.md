# RAG System for Contract Q&A

## Introduction

Welcome to the RAG System for Contract Q&A! This repository contains the codebase and resources for building, evaluating, and improving a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Question & Answering (Q&A). The goal is to develop a powerful contract assistant that can autonomously answer questions about contracts, with the ultimate aim of creating a fully autonomous contract bot capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts independently.

## Background Context

### What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI model that combines the power of large language models with external data sources. RAG leverages a large language model to generate responses but first retrieves relevant information from external data sources, enabling it to provide more accurate and context-rich outputs.

## Data for Evaluation

The repository contains an evaluation set with two contracts (a short one and a long one), each with a list of ten questions and their correct answers.

## Repository Structure

-   **/code:** Contains the codebase for the RAG system.
-   **/data:** Contains the evaluation set and any additional datasets used.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AbelBekele/Contract-Advisor-RAG-.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Explore the codebase to understand the RAG system and evaluation set.
4.  Run the RAG system on the evaluation set and analyze the results.
5.  Experiment with different techniques to improve RAG performance.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the RAG system or resources to add, please submit a pull request.
